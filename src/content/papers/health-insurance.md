## Introduction

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec a diam lectus. Sed sit amet ipsum mauris.

## Data and Methodology

We use a difference-in-differences approach combined with propensity score matching to identify the causal effect of remittances on farm productivity.

## Results

Our findings suggest that households receiving remittances:
1. Invest more in agricultural inputs
2. Recover more quickly from natural disasters
3. Have higher farm productivity in the post-disaster period

## Conclusion

The results highlight the importance of remittances as a risk-coping mechanism for rural households in developing countries.
